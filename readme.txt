== Description ==

This is a plugin that adds a widget that you can use to showcase your most recent posts in the sidebar of your WordPress powered website.

The widget utilizes the "featured image" set in your WordPress posts and will also display the post title, date and comment count.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will there ever be more options added? =

Yes, I do have plans on adding more options for this widget. In particular, I already have plans to allow selections for the thumbnail size (currently 75x75), selecting what post info you'd like displayed (date, comments, category, etc) and also post excerpts.
